    <h1>Shower Thoughts</h1>
    <ul><li>Why is W called double U when it clearly looks more like a Double V</li>.

      <li>Who the hell came up with shirt buttons and why is it called the same name as a button that I can press.Buttons shoudnt be able to be pressed, only the shirts that they are on.
</li>
<li> i wanna become a button collector so bad</li>
<li> hate letters that you dont send are just as important to write if not more, than love letters</li>
<li>its been raining for 4 months now, pls stop, i need vitamin d, i need mr.sun without it being dermi cool weather</li>

<li> most people are talking to themselves when talking to you, what theyre telling u is what they wished someone would tell them or narratives they already feed themselves, remember that so as to not take things personally and seperate your being from their word and opinions</li>

    </ul>
