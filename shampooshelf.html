    DONE CONSUMING , HERE IS REVIEW
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Read Passing for Human by Liana Finck - 4/5 </p>
     <br>
     <br>
      <p>I GOT SHUSHED IN F1 The Movie ( not clickbait) <br>
       for celebrating loudly everytime the protagonist is MADE to pay his dues despite " the hero never getting shot" thing , not just sshed but told off by some teen kids ( well desreved , because I laughed in a really emo scene and clapped when Brad Pitt had his biggest lost lol), anyways great antagonist,mostly everyone had a grey character which was great, also HANS ZIMMER BG MUSIC, AMAZING VISUALS, great camera angles, very very visually clean and good looking, made to watch in the cinema!</p>
