       <li>READ Passing for Human by Liana Finck and OH MY GOD im genuinely speechless, it is the most unique way of book structure plus expressing oneself I have ever seen, and best of all (or not) I understand her, Liana, so much, she's just like me in her strange ways. I feel seen and also my dil ki taar has been stretched , i cried out of mixed emotions, this book made me so emo but made me feel less alien. It made me realise that : 1.i not so strange and 2. i might wanna put myself out there more in case there are any other lianas or ananyas who might feel seen through my stuff </li>

       <li> Will be reading- More days at the Morisaki Bookshop next.</li>
