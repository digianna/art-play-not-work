    DONE CONSUMING , HERE IS REVIEW
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Read Passing for Human by Liana Finck and OH MY GOD im genuinely speechless, it is the most unique book structure ive ever come across let alone in the genre of memoirs and best of all (or not) I understand her, Liana, so much, she's just like me in her strange ways. I feel seen and also my dil ki taar has been stretched , i cried out of mixed emotions, this book made me so emo but made me feel less alien. I loved how her book is basically different drafts of the same book, I GET IT, and her using the theme of the sun and moon , once again I GET IT. I have found a soul sister across the globe , thank you for existing and creating Liana. It made me realise that : 1.i not so strange and 2. i might wanna put myself out there more in case there are any other lianas or ananyas who might feel seen through my stuff. </p>

     <br>
     <p> rewatched a lil marvelous ms maisel and i still like it, might go ahead in the episodes this time but lets see </p>
     <br>
     <br>
      <p> tiss fodcast is gettin too boyish and mumbai centric for me, i really wanna find another podcast thats not so heavy , light and fun and infotainment like , but for now i am still watching their eps, nothing beats these for now, i tried other comics ka stuff. comfort zone is also made w these boys maybe thas why eet hard to find someone new. theyre like my tmkoc safe space hmm. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>I GOT SHUSHED IN F1 The Movie ( not clickbait) <br>
       for celebrating loudly everytime the protagonist is MADE to pay his dues despite " the hero never getting shot" thing , not just sshed but told off by some teen kids ( well desreved , because I laughed in a really emo scene and clapped when Brad Pitt had his biggest lost lol), anyways great antagonist,mostly everyone had a grey character which was great, also HANS ZIMMER BG MUSIC, AMAZING VISUALS, great camera angles, very very visually clean and good looking, made to watch in the cinema!</p>
