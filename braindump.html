    <h1>Turning 25, what is life</h1>
  <p> Letter to self- Hi, we haven't been super in touch for a while. You're doing well, I see you. Age is just a number and does not tell you much actually.Right now, I don't have much to say- no advice to give , nothing. Just don't be sad on your birthday Xd, get a flower and eat a slice of cake with a candle, maybe a cheese sw and frooti?, minimal ,no stressin out. it's time to take responsibility and accountability of yourself now, you,we can do this. you already know how to make good habits,and bad. Pick your battles and focus on yourself and your well being. Everything I hope follows suit from there. see you on the 25th for le 25th !
    P.s. think about what you want in your coming years, starting work-wise.
