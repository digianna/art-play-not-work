Warning : the following stuff has been written in pure emotion, little logic, art is born out of strong feeling, do not give me life advice , this is how I process , thanks . Please leave this Sasti Sylvia Plath alone.
Since I was young ( im 24, still young but let me have this) I have lost a lot of people in my life. Lost is not exclusive to being dead , it also means due to me shifting cities, them shifting cities, not staying near family, family moving abroad ,stupid fights, my school shuffling the students into new classes every new year (yOu NeeD to leArn tO gEt aLonG wItH everYOne) , changing schools, changing social dynamics, etc. etc. so my initial fear of losing people I really like or feel comfortable with- started early ( with no thanks to the extra help I got from watching CID – “oh no I hope dad doesn’t get stabbed on his office tour”, Lion King, Spiderman and Kal Ho Na Ho- did not help that SRK and my brother share the same name ugh). Okay so it wasn’t SO much also but I’m a sensitive gal okay, spending time 24/7 with mom , then having to start going to school ALSO felt huge, even though id see her in the evening. Making friends in school but then being separated because we’re being too giggly and worst of all being made to sit w A BOY yuck ( young boys annoy girls to make friends with them, but I didn’t know that and used to take a bunch of it personally lol) , it always feels like due to something or the other I just do not get to be around the people I like, as much as I’d want. From the boy who’s silent presence started to make me feel safe in the bus who then shifted away, to one of my fav people in the world dying when I was 8 to all my buddies moving away for studying or jobs, to making awesome new friends and seeing them move away as well, (ill miss you loads T2) , it feels pretty sucky to be left alone writing this breakup heartbreak type letter in my room.
Ofc one can say that I’m lucky to have met some of these crazy amazing people which is why it sux so much to constantly having to bid farewell to everybody. This led to me building up a skill of being able to talk to anyone, anywhere, and make friends everywhere. But the curse doesn’t lift, people always move. I hope this changes, until then , I guess Ill keep making friends everywhere :’) and then watch them go away (it’s so tiring), but even after so long it still sucks and I’m unfortunately not immune to it which is a good thing? that Im still human and not a numb robot but still sux for everyday me. Boohoo womp womp ok bye.
p.s. this feels like a mild curse u give someone to someone u hate like I hope ur favourite food never tastes quite as good, which one of u did this to meeee??!! *HISSS* Curse u curserrr, may your cursor never be exactly where u want and hope u accidentally click on all the malware installing ads .
