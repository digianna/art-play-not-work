    <h1> Huh? What is all this? </h1>

<p>This website is a playful ode to washrooms i.e.spaces that, for me, have always felt like tiny sanctuaries wherever I go. Whether it's at school, in someone else's home, in a bustling restaurant, or even in my own house, the washroom has been that one bubble of privacy, the one boundary everyone agrees not to cross.

This is my lighthearted take on the washroom as a micro-environment ,whilst turning it into seperate sections of reflection type journalling, writing and sketches.Unserious fun basically.<br>
