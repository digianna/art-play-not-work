    <h1> Huh? What is all this? </h1>

<p>This website is a playful ode to washrooms i.e.spaces that, for me, have always felt like tiny sanctuaries wherever I go. Whether it's at school, in someone else's home, in a bustling restaurant, or even in my own house, the washroom has been that one bubble of privacy, the one boundary everyone agrees not to cross.

This is my lighthearted take on the washroom as a micro-environment , how we experience it, and how it weaves itself into the fabric of our everyday lives.<br>
tl;dr toilet themed fun space woohoo or shall i say poopoo- this should set your expectations for the quality of the content you will see on this website <br>


Here’s how the site works:

<ul>
  <li>Shower Thoughts → A corner for those moments when ideas just happen.</li>

<li>Shampoo Bottle Shelf → The “waiting period” spot: transitions, daydreaming, or reading shampoo labels out of sheer boredom.</li>

<li>The WC → A brain dump zone for when your mind feels constipated with thoughts.</li>

<li> Toilet Paper → A place for those scrappy, random doodles made without thinking.</li> </p>
